# Jigsaw toxic severity rating kaggle competition

This Git contains my work done for the last project of the Machine Learning Engineer path of OpenClassroom which is the participation to the **Kaggle Competition Jigsaw Severity Rate of Toxic Comments **


**CC_pipeline_rf** is a copy of my public kernel in which I use a Classifier Chains with random Forest to predict the different class of toxicity and then I apply a score of toxicity function.

**Grid_search_LR/RF** are the codes of the grid searchs to find the best parameters for the Classifiers Chains with Logistic Regression / Random Forest

**P8_analyse** is my data analysis

**P8_first_model** is my first model which is a regression of the toxicity score.

**bert_classification** is bert using a classification layer

**bert_embedding** is when I use bert as an embedding for antoher model
